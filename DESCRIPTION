Description: This packages allows to retrieve air pollution data from the Air
  Information Resource (UK-AIR, <https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/>) of the
  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in the United
  Kingdom. UK-AIR does not provide a public API for programmatic access to data,
  therefore this package scrapes the HTML pages to get relevant information.
  The package is described in Vitolo et al. (2016) "rdefra: Interact with the
  UK AIR Pollution Database from DEFRA" <doi:10.21105/joss.00051>.
