}
\arguments{
\item{site_name}{This is the name of a specific site. By default this is left
blank to get info on all the available sites.}

\item{pollutant}{This is a number from 1 to 10. Default is 9999, which means
all the pollutants.}

\item{group_id}{This is the identification number of a group of stations.
Default is 9999 which means all available networks.}

\item{closed}{This is "true" to include closed stations, "false" otherwise.}

\item{country_id}{This is the identification number of the country, it can be
a number from 1 to 6. Default is 9999, which means all the countries.}

\item{region_id}{This is the identification number of the region. 1 =
Aberdeen City, etc. (for the full list see
\url{https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/}). Default is 9999, which means all the
local authorities.}

\item{location_type}{This is the identification number of the location type.
Default is 9999, which means all the location types.}
}
\value{
A dataframe listing stations and related information.
